# **Weather P.I.T.**

#### An Android mobile application that uses the Dark Sky API to return weather data to the user. July 9, 2016

#### By **Nick Lyman**

## Description

This mobile application allows the user to enter a city and state, then displays the current weather plus historic weather for that date. The year value is randomly generated so when the application is refreshed, the user will see different data to compare with the current weather information. A dynamic line graph will show the differences by hour between the two API responses. The user will also be able to see the seven day forecast for the city they chose.
